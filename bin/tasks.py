# ======================================================
# Uss file_tasks or dir_tasks to create the tasks file.
# Using both of them or one of them is ok.
# By the way, the images will cover themselves.

# example:

# file_tasks = ['D:\\1.jpg', 'D:\\2.jpg']
# dir_tasks = ['D:\\dir1', 'D:\\dir2']
